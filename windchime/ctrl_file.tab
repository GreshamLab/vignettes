Here's an idea: In addition to the Adaptive nanopore sequencing we also focus on the impacts of Gabriel's 
Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP), which (if I understand correctly) does the field sample collections.

How summer collection of materials with SURP participants Impacts you : 
1) Terrestrial/Soil field work experience 
2) Field experiment design 
3) Undergraduate research assistant experience

How summer collection of materials with SURP participants Impacts others : 
1) Undergraduate exposure to field research.
2) Development of undergraduate appropriate experimental methods.
3) Collection of samples at a very large scale.
4) Potentially you could do metal analysis on the sediments collected too - this could be a new method you would bring to the summer program
